The Flatshare Management App is a support tool for shared apartments that facilitates the organization of shopping and general tasks.

### **Feature Overview:**
- **Login and Registration:** Upon accessing the website, the user is automatically redirected to the login page, where they can either log in or register if it's their first time using the app.
- **Home Page:** After logging in, the home page is displayed, which represents the entire application as a single-page application.
